# Introduction

I have played many games since I was a tiny girl.

When I started to play my most recent game God of War Ragnarok, I have come to realize that many video games draw inspiration for their world-buiding and aesthetics from religious theme.

Therefore, I start this project to see the connection between video games, their genres, their developers, their publishers, and religious ideas.

# How the project works

I have used what I learned in the session "Network Analysis" to construct a graph showing different connections between five elements (game titles, genres, devs, publishers, religious ideas).

Tools I use: Excel, OpenRefine, Palladio.

### I. Create a spreadsheet

At this first step, I create a spreadsheet using Excel.

I put on five different categories which are game titles, genres, developers, publishers, and religious ideas).

Now I have 32 game titles. 

Then I saved the file as csv. format

### II. Use OpenRefine

I loaded the file into OpenRefine.
