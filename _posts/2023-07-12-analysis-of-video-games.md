title: An Analysis of Video Games and Religions
categories: [content, demo]

I have played many games since I was a tiny girl.
When I started to play my most recent game God of War Ragnarok, I have come to realize that many video games draw inspiration for their world-buiding and aesthetics from religious theme.
Therefore, I start this project to see the connection between video games, their genres, their developers, their publishers, and religious ideas.

## How the project works

I have used what I learned in the session "Network Analysis" to construct a graph showing different connections between five elements (game titles, genres, devs, publishers, religious ideas).
