The first lesson that I learned from the course is how to create a blog using Jekyll template on Github.

This is a very interesting lesson, since it helps us establish a certain vision for our study in this course.

It is no exaggeration to say that this lesson is the foundation for the course, due to the fact that we will use it the most, since we have a task of creating five posts at the end of the semester.

# What is GitHub

Github is 

> a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.

# How to create a blog using Jekyll template

At first you must have a github account. This one is very easy. Once we have the account, we will go to the template and start using the template. This one is also very fast and easy.

# Difficulties

When we need to learn to change the content of the template to our liking, I stumbled upon trouble. 

Mine did not appear normally, as it did not show anything on screen.

After asking the lecturer, I realized that I have made a mistake. 

According to the guildline:

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/posts/Screenshot 2023-08-31 210410.png)

My repository has to have the same name as my github user name. But unfortunately, I did not. Therefore, it cannot recognize my blog and that is why my blog is error. 

After fixing the above problem, I can finally use my blog. 

But once more, I encountered another problem when trying to post something on the blog.

I uploaded my post but nothing appeared on the blog. I did go to the `_posts` folder to add my post, but nothing happened. 

Then I realized that when it asks me to change the file name, I should have renamed it with the same format `.md` at the end. 

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/posts/Screenshot 2023-08-31 211312.png)

I fixed the name and voila the post appeared on my blog.


# Furthermore

One more lesson I learned that day is about the domain.

The below is a link leading to a page on Moodle:

> https://moodle.rub.de/course/view.php?id=123#section4sftp

The lecturer explained the meaning behind every element featured in this link.

`https:` is the protocol which will send command to other computers.

`//moodle.rub.de/` is the server which is the name of the other computer, in which `de` indicates German domain region.

<mark >What is domain?</mark> 

<small>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).
</small>

`/course/view.php` is the path leads to the files.

`?id=123` is the parameter to know which exact file we want to see

`#section4` anchor or fragment which is a location within the documents	

`sftp` is the protocol to transfer files within our computer.

And these are the things I have learned so far in this class.
