# What is a Application Programming Interface?

~~API (application programming interface) is a type of software interface (interface: a shared boundary between system components).~~

A Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules to control and communicate with application functionalities via a programming language. The Implementation of these interfaces can be programmed to be only accessible via specific high-level programing languages like c++ or python, or can be using more generalistic API Structures like Representational state transfer (REST), Web Sockets, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or simple TCP/IP calls with a formatted (e.g. in JSONl) payload.

<summary><b>So what does this software interface do?</b></summary>

>In building applications, an API simplifies programming by abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developers needs.<br>
While a graphical interface for an email client might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file input/output might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occurring behind the scenes.

<blockquote>
<h1>This is a header</h1>
Test 123

<h1>Another Block Quote</h1>
If everything is marked as a block quote multiple lines can be achieved too this way!
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Splitting them up is super simple too.

unordered list:
<ul>
  <li>Note A</li>
  <li>Note B</li>
</ul>

Ordered list:
<ol>
  <li>Ordered List 1</li>
  <li>Ordered List 2</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>

ofc nesting theses are possible too!

second line

<h1>This is a header</h1>

1. Item One
2. Item Two

And a codeblock..

```python 
#!/usr/bin/python
# Code Block:
def code_block_py():
   print('Hello World')
```
<br>

# Nominatim

During the lesson, I was introduced to Nominatim.
