# What is a Application Programming Interface?

~~API (application programming interface) is a type of software interface (interface: a shared boundary between system components).~~

A Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules to control and communicate with application functionalities via a programming language. The Implementation of these interfaces can be programmed to be only accessible via specific high-level programing languages like c++ or python, or can be using more generalistic API Structures like Representational state transfer (REST), Web Sockets, Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or simple TCP/IP calls with a formatted (e.g. in JSONl) payload.

>In building applications, an API simplifies programming by abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developers needs.<br>
While a graphical interface for an email client might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file input/output might give the developer a function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occurring behind the scenes.

During the lesson, I was introduced to Nominatim.
