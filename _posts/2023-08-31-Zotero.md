# What is Zotero

Before the lesson, I have already used `Zotero` before, hence, I have quite experience with this program. Besides Zotero, I also use `Citavi`, but this one is a paid program, so financially-wise, zotero is better.

### So what is Zotero?

Zotero is a program that can help you organize your database, in this case, is a bibliography for research.

<mark>What is database?</mark>
> Think of a table with columns for each category (authors, book titles, publishers).
> 
| Authors     | Book Titles | Publishers|
| ----------- | ----------- |-----------|
| Durkheim. Emile     |  Suicide  | Oxford University Press|
| Weber, Max   | The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism| Routledge|

### What else Zotero can do?

Beside organizing bibliography, Zotero can also help you to cite in your text editor.

Zotero also can be enabled into your browse as an extension to be able to automatically collect articles or books and add them to your local bibliography.

# How to use Zotero?

## Step 1

Open Zotero, on the main page, find the `+` to add contents and then choose options for your type of material (book, journal article,etc.)

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/posts/Adding%202.png)


## Step 2

When added, on the right side of the screen, there will be several options for you to fill up (authors, book title, editors, date, publisher, etc.)

## Step 3

After step 2, open your text editor (mine is microsoft word).

Looking for Zotero here:

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/posts/Get_Access_In_Word.png)

There will be a red and white bar appear in the center of the screen:

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/posts/Cite1.png)

## Step 4

Entering your desired information (author's name, book title,etc.) and then the red bar will show you result like this:

In this example, I tried to find the book named "The Trickster"

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/posts/Cite2.png)

Choose the right options among the recommendations. After that, a citation will appear:

![Alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/posts/Cite4.png)

This is how I normally use Zotero.
