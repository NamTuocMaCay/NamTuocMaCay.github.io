# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way of formatting text files. When using Markdown syntax, you can be able to transform your files into readable plain text and other formats. For example, on GitHub, any markdown files would be rendered into HTML for display on the web.

# How to use Markdown

Markdown syntax is very easy to use.

Above is how Markdown works when using in `Visual Studio Code`. On the left is the raw code and on the right is the preview of the code's result if been read on any website format. 

### 1. How to write headings

Every heading starts with symbol `#`. If you want a big heading, use one `#`, smaller uses `##` and even smaller uses `###`. The more hash signs, the smaller the heading will be.

For example, `# Step1`, `## Step 2`, and `### Step 3` will look like this:

> # Step1
> ## Step2
> ### Step 3

### 2. How to emphasize words

1. If you want to highlight the text, you can use this syntax `<mark>text</mark>` or use the symbol `=`.

For example, `<mark>step1<mark>` will look like this:

> <mark>step1</mark>


2. If you want to make your words in **bold**, you can use the symbol `*` or `_`. Just put two astericks or underscores before and after the desired text.

For example, `**step1**` or `_step1_` will look like this:

>**step1**

3. If you want to *italicize* your words, then use the same symbol `*` and `_` but reduces the numbers of these symbols before and after the desired text. Just one is enough.

For example, `*step1*` or `_step_` will look like this:

>*step1*

3. If you want to do both ***italic and bold*** at the same time, increase the `*` and `_`. Instead of two or one, put three before and after the text.

For example, `***step1***` or `___step1___` will look like this:

>***step1***

4. If you want to create blockquote, just need to add the symbol `>` in front of the text.

For example, `>first step to use markdown` will be like this:

> first step to use markdown

### 3. How to create lists

This is super easy. Just do the same as you usually do in text editor, with putting numbers in front of each item.

But if you want an unordered list, then you can use dash `-`, asterisks `*`, or plus signs `+` before the items.

For example,  
`- Step 1`  
`- Step 2`  
`- Step 3`

would be like this after rendering

- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3

### 3. How to add images and links

To add images, just use this syntax:  
`![Alt text](here you add the link leading to your image)`

For example, `![Alt text](https://assets/image/avatar.png)` will be like this:

![Alt text](https://assets/image/avatar.png)

To add an URL or email address, enclose them in angle brackets.

`<https://www.markdownguide.org>`  
`<letrananhthu222@gmail.com>`

The result will be like this:

><https://www.markdownguide.org>  
>
><letrananhthu222@gmail.com>


The above are most exemplary syntax using in Markdown.
