# What is Web Scraping

### Definition

>**Web scraping** is the process of extracting data from websites. Scraping data from a website includes:
>- `Crawler`: Fetching data from a web page: download a page (fetching pages).
>- `Scraper`: Extracting data from a web page: parsing, searching, and reformatting the content of the page and the collected data will be copied and organized into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database.

In short, imagine you want some information from a website, a large amounts of them. In this case, doing the work manually (copy and paste) will be a futile attempt. Therefore, you need a `web scraper` to get a lot of data sets.

So how does it exactly work?  
According to ***geeksforgeeks*** website:
>So, when a web scraper needs to scrape a site, first the URLs are provided. Then it loads all the HTML code for those sites and a more advanced scraper might even extract all the CSS and Javascript elements as well. Then the scraper obtains the required data from this HTML code and outputs this data in the format specified by the user. Mostly, this is in the form of an Excel spreadsheet or a CSV file, but the data can also be saved in other formats, such as a JSON file.

And this is certainly how web scraping actually does.

We need a program to do web scraping. In this case, I have learned to use `OpenRefine`.
